* The dataset comes from Kaggle. Good thing to use this datasete is that I can use the commonsense to cheak the result of plot. What is more, because many earthquakes happened in the ocean, so that it is impossible to say some earthquakes happened in which countries. Therefore, there could be some inaccuracy in the bar chart. 
* In order to fix this error, I combine the world map with the spots of earthquakes. The first chart is a basic point polt. 
* To make the polt more meaningful, magnitute can be adopted to reset the size of spots. 
* In the end, the earthquake zones shows up. 
* The most diccult part is still the data engineering. Thanks to the stakeoverflow and useful R packages.
